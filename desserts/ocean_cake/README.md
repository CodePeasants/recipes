# Ocean Cake
![Island cake](ocean_cake.png)

This tropical island-inspired cake has 3 main components:

- Cake island base
- Gelatin ocean, set around the cake base
- Decorations in the form of:
    - Sea life set in the gelatin water
    - sand, rocks, tree's etc.. placed or painted on the cake surface above the water line.
    - foam painted on the water surface.

To make the cake vegetarian, we will use agar agar instead of regular gelatin.

> **Note**: Agar agar metls at a higher temperture than gelatin and becomes more firm. Must be dissolved in boiling liquid to melt (~100 C). You only need a ratio of 2-3% of the liquid's volume of agar agar powder.

## Videos

main steps, just with different designs.
