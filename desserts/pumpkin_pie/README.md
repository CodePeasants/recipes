## Recipes

### Pie Crust
This makes enough dough for 2 pies, or one pie with a cover. If you make the full recipe, cut the dough in half to roll out crust and use
the rest for decoration. I used the other half the make a braid that I attached to the rim of the pie crust that looks nice (egg wash it when baked)
along with some leaves I made with a glass as a cookie cutter and a knife to cut veins in leaves, to place on top of the pie. Bake those when you
blind-bake the crust and save them to top the pie later.

#### Ingredients
- 3 cups all purpose flour
- 8 oz butter
- 1 cup ice cold water

#### Instructions
- All ingredients should be COLD (even flour if you can)
- cut butter into small cubes
- mix all ingredients except water in stand mixer for 1-2 minutes on low speed (should still have chunks of butter)
- mix in most of the water - add the rest as needed for a lumpy shaggy dough - mix only until water is just incorperated - DO NOT OVER MIX
- dump onto floured surface and press dough together flat. Fold on itself, press flat and repeat a couple times
    - Should end up fairly loose and not smooth with globs of butter still
